        publish and finalize methods, so that the settings can be used to drive the publish process.

        The widget argument is the widget that was previously created by

        The method returns a dictionary, where the key is the name of a

        when multiple tasks have been selected.

        values of the settings for selected tasks. The settings dictionaries
